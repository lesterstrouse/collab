1.Data Source: Kaggle (Titanic:Train and Test Data)
2.libraries imported: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, csv, os, pandas as pd, numpy as np, seaborn as sns
3.Loading and reading of CSV files
4.Combining both train data and test data to do cleaing and filling missed data, where it is feasibly safe to fill without much alteration to the existing data
5.Once data cleaned, Splitting up test and train data to do analysis
6.Overal Survival to death ration of whole population boarded
7.Overall Age distribution in Ship boarded details shown by histogram. Show thre is more population in age group 25-35
8.In the line graph, we see the survival to age ratio, there is more percentage of survival in children, and there is more death in the peak age boarded as described 
in previous graph.
9. Age Survival per Fare analysis
In this we see, green color is survived and red is dead, bigger the circle higher the fare. We see that as the fare goes on increasing, the probbaility of survival 
increasees may be due to better seating arrangement or major priority in sending them out on first available lifeboats
10. Box Plot between male and female. - Box plot, though shows almost similar, says that more women have taken higher fare ticket in comparison to men, which 
explains the next graph
11. Survived to death based on sex analysis, shows more women were survived compared to men
12. Coming to the Passenger Class Location in the ship, prediction of survival is counted, shows the people located at top floors of ship has more chances of survival
compared to people located on basement and lower floors because, one of the major reason is the submerged ice caused crack in the ship from basement, where in water
started to come in and peple had less time to escape. This is shown in 2 graphs, one how many in each location, how many survived in each class
13. This may be coincidence, taking on the embarked stations, people pertaining to embarkment station S have made through survival compared to other 2 stations.
14. Based on SibSp or Parch, its similar to embarked stations graph. It says, chances are more to survive, if you are not alone. very delicate supporting
